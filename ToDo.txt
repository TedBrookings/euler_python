Add unit tests for the helper files:
  digit_math.py
  fibonacci.py
  number_words.py
  permutation.py
  primes.py

Do more problems

Check all usage of digit_math.py : getNumDigits
  previous increased digit 1 number too late (e.g. said 100 had 2, 101 had 3)
  now fails at large numbers due to rounding error
    genDigits with leastFirst=False has extra if statement to catch this

Make all euler functions return answer so that verified answers can be used in
  unit tests

In the future, always unit tests first
