Add unit tests for the helper files:
  fibonacci.py
  number_words.py
  permutation.py
  primes.py

Do more problems

Make all euler functions return answer so that verified answers can be used in
  unit tests

Make all problem files use argparse to pass arguments

In all files that use range, alias range -> xrange if version < 3

In the future, always unit tests first
