Add unit tests for the helper files:
  fibonacci.py
  number_words.py
  permutation.py
  primes.py
Add test.py that calls all unit tests

Do more problems

Make all euler functions return answer so that verified answers can be used in
  unit tests
  -Need to rename problem files to start with a letter, since python has
   trouble importing files whose name starts with a number
  
Make all problem files use argparse to pass arguments

In the future, always unit tests first
