This repository holds solutions to problems from Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/problems) written in python. Problems are solved in python files with three-digit numbers (e.g. 007.py). Some problems rely on supplementary data, which is stored in text files in the /data directory. Additional files:
  run_euler.py runs and times each of the problems
  problem files are of form euler???.py and solve the numbered problem
  additional helper files are python modules imported by the problem files
  LICENSE.txt is the MIT license
  ToDo.txt is an aspirational file of future work
